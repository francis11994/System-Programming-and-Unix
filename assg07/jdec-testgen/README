jdec-testgen is intended to help you test your Java Decompiler (jdec)
program.  It reads in from stdin an expression involving the same 
operators  as jdec, and writes to stdout a sequence of instructions
in the same instruction set used by jdec.  So you can feed an
expression into jdec-testgen, then take the output it produces and
feed that into jdec, and should get back the same expression that
you began with (except possibly for differences in whitespace).

Example (the shell prompt is shown as '% '):
-------

Suppose we put the expression   (x+y)*w - z   in a file foo, then
run jdec-testgen as follows:

  % jdec-testgen  <  foo
  Enter an expression, followed by control-D or EOF

  iload  x
  iload  y
  iadd
  iload  w
  imul
  iload  z
  isub

You can copy-paste these JVM instructions into a file, let's say bar,
and feed it to your JVM decompiler program jdec as follows:

  % jdec < bar

If everything goes well, your jdec program should print out something like:

  (((x + y) * w) - z)

which is the same as the original expression (but fully-parenthesized
and with whitespace differences, which are OK).

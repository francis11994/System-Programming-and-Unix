<h1>CSc 352: Spellcheck</h1>

This program aims to give you further experience in working
with pointers and dynamic memory allocation, and get you started 
with command-line arguments and file I/O.
<p/>

<h2>The Problem</h2>

Write a C program that reads in a document, extracts words, and checks them for spelling
errors against a dictionary, as specified below.
<p/>
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Definitions:</b>
    For the purposes of this problem, a <i><u>word</u></i> is defined to be any sequence of upper- and
    lower-case letters.  The spell-check process is not case-sensitive, so the words &quot;aND&quot; 
    and  &quot;and&quot; are considered to be the same.
    <p/>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Invocation:</b> Your program will be compiled to an executable named
    <b>spellcheck</b> (see under <b>Makefile</b> below).  It will be invoked as follows:
    <blockquote>
      <b>spellcheck</b> &nbsp; <b>-d</b> <i>dictionaryFile</i> &nbsp; 
      	[ <b>-u</b> ] &nbsp; 
      	[ <b>-i</b> <i>inputFile</i> ]
    </blockquote>
    where square brackets around an argument indicate that the argument is optional:
    <p/>
    <ul>
      <li>
	<i>dictionaryFile</i> is the name of a file containing the dictionary, i.e.,
	a list of the &quot;official&quot; correct spellings of words.
      </li>
      <li>
	The (optional) command-line option &quot;<b>-u</b> &quot; indicates that spelling-error reports
	should be <i>unique</i>, i.e., each misspelled word should be reported exactly once.  
	If &quot;<b>-u</b>&quot; is not specified, each misspelled word is to be reported each time it is
	encountered, regardless of whether or not it was reported earlier.
      </li>
      <li>
        <i>inputFile</i> is the name of a file from which the input to be spell-checked is to be read.  
        If no file is specified, input should be read from <b>stdin</b>.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p/>
    The arguments may be specified in any order.  Thus, the following are all legal and have
    equivalent behavior:
    <blockquote>
      <b><tt>spellcheck -d mydict -u -i foo.txt</tt></b><br/>
      <b><tt>spellcheck -u -d mydict -i foo.txt</tt></b><br/>
      <b><tt>spellcheck -i foo.txt -u -d mydict</tt></b><br/>
      <b><tt>spellcheck -i foo.txt -d mydict -u</tt></b>
    </blockquote>
    <p/>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>File names:</b> For this problem, it is illegal for a file name 
    (either the dictionary or, if specified, the input file) to begin with the
    character <b><tt>'-'</tt></b>.
    <p/>
    The reason for this restriction is to make the meaning of command-line arguments
    for this problem unambiguous.  For example, without this restriction, one could
    imagine a scenario where the program is invoked as
    <blockquote>
      <b><tt>spellcheck  -d -i -i -d</tt></b>
    </blockquote>
    where the dictionary file is named &quot;<b><tt>-i</tt></b>&quot; and
    the input file is named &quot;<b><tt>-d</tt></b>&quot;, which would be messy to
    deal with properly.
    <p/>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Behavior:</b> 
    Your program should read in the list of words from the dictionary specified.  It should then
    read text from the input stream, discarding non-letter characters
    (i.e., digits, whitespace, punctuation, etc) to form words.  For each such word, your code
    should search the list of words read in from the dictionary.  If the input word is not found in
    the dictionary, it should be printed out to <b>stdout</b> (unless &quot;<b>-u</b>&quot;
    is specified and the same word was encountered earlier).
    <p/>
    Each misspelt word that is encountered in the input stream and which is to be printed
    out should be printed on a line by itself using the statement
    <blockquote>
      <b><tt>printf(&quot;%s\n&quot;, word)</tt></b>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Dictionary:</b> A dictionary is simply a list of words.
    An example (with about 45,000 words) is available <a href="WORDS">here</a>; 
    a bigger example (with about 109,000 words) is available at
    <a href="http://www-01.sil.org/linguistics/wordlists/english/">
    http://www-01.sil.org/linguistics/wordlists/english/</a>.
    <p/>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Errors:</b> 
    Error messages should be sensible and informative (use <b>perror</b> where necessary)
    and should be sent to <b>stderr</b>.
    <p/>
    The following are all fatal errors and should cause the program
    to exit immediately with exit status <b>1</b>.
    <p/>
    <ul>
      <li>
	The dictionary is not specified.
      </li>
      <li>
	The dictionary cannot be opened for reading.
      </li>
      <li>
	&quot;<b><tt>-i</tt></b>&quot; is specified but no input file name is given.
      </li>
      <li>
	The dictionary and/or the input file (if specified) begins with the
	letter <b><tt>'-'</tt></b>.  In other words,
	the argument following &quot;<b><tt>-d</tt></b>&quot;
	and/or &quot;<b><tt>-i</tt></b>&quot; begins with the letter <b><tt>'-'</tt></b>.
      </li>
      <li>
        An input file is specified but this file cannot be opened for reading.
      </li>
      <li>
        The command line arguments contain options other than
	&quot;<b>-d</b>&quot;, &quot;<b>-i</b>&quot;,
	or &quot;<b>-u</b>&quot;.
      </li>
      <li>
	One or more command line option is repeated 
	(e.g, &quot;<b>-d</b> <i>file1</i> <b>-d</b> <i>file2</i>).
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p/>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Assumptions and Restrictions</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Assumptions:</b> You may assume that a word is at most 64
    characters long, and that strings read by <b>scanf</b> are
    at most 512 characters long.
    <p/>
  </li>
  <li>
     <b>Restrictions:</b> 
     The point of this exercise is to work with
     pointers and dynamic data structures.  You should use a dynamic data
     structure, such as a linked list, to hold the words read in
     from the dictionary (and, if &quot;<b>-u</b>&quot; is specified,
     the misspelled words encountered).  Programs that use 
     statically preallocated memory will not get credit.  You will also
     not get credit for solutions that use <b>realloc</b> or which
     simulate <b>realloc</b> by making repeated calls to <b>malloc</b> or
     <b>calloc</b>.
     <p/>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Building and Testing Your Program</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Code coverage:</b> 
    In addition to the source code for your program, you should submit
    test cases that achieve at least 90% code coverage under <b>gcov</b>.
    Code coverage tests will be done on code that
    has been formatted using <b>indent &ndash;kr</b>.
    <p/>
    Writing code coverage tests for this problem has two wrinkles, both related to
    the fact that the program's execution is no longer driven just by inputs
    read from <b>stdin</b>.  First, the execution paths taken&ndash;and therefore
    the code coverage obtained&ndash;will depend on the command line options specified.
    Second, the program's execution will depend on the dictionary and/or input files
    specified.
    <p/>
    To deal with these issue, submit your code coverage tests in a directory
    <b>tests</b> as specified below.
    <p/>
    <ul>
      <li>
	The directory <b>tests</b> contains the files (both dictionaries and input
	files) used by your coverage tests.  You can name these files whatever you like.
      </li>
      <li>
	The directory <b>tests</b> contains a single file <b>runtests</b> that
	contains a set of commands to run your spellcheck program, one command per line.
	An example is shown <a href="example-runtests-spellcheck" target="_blank">here</a>.
	Once you have created this file of commands, you can execute all of the
	commands within this file using the command
	<blockquote>
	  <b><tt>sh  tests/runtests</tt></b>
	</blockquote>
	<b>Note:</b> Each command in the <b>tests/runtests</b> file should work when
	executed in the directory containing the Makefile and the executable for
	this program.
	<p/>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p/>	
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Makefile:</b>
    In addition to your source files, you should submit a make file
    named <b>Makefile</b> that supports at least the following functionality:
    <blockquote>
      <dl>
        <dt><b>make spellcheck</b></dt>
        <dd>Compiles the C source code to create an executable named
    	<b><tt>spellcheck</tt></b>.  The compiler options used should
    	include <b><tt>-Wall</tt></b>.
    	<p/>
      </dd>
      <dt><b>make coverage</b> (phony target)</dt>
      <dd>
        Compiles the source program with the <b>gcc</b> options needed
        by the <b>gcov</b> tool, namely, 
        &quot;<b><tt>-fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage</tt></b>&quot;.
        <p/>
      </dd>
      <dt><b>make clean</b> (phony target)</dt>
      <dd>
        Deletes all object files (<b><tt>*.o</tt></b>), if any, as well as the
        executable <b><tt>spellcheck</tt></b> and files generated by <b>gcov</b>
        (<b><tt>*.gcov, *.gcno, *.gcda</tt></b>).
      </dd>
      </dl>
    </blockquote>
    <p/>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Submitting Your Assignment</h2>
    Collect all of the files related to this assignment, as described below, into a
    directory named <b>spellcheck</b> and use the <b><tt>turnin</tt></b> command to submit
    this directory (this will cause all of the files in the directory to be submitted).
    The directory <b>spellcheck</b> should contain:
    <p/>
    <ul>
      <li>
        the C source code for your program;
      </li>
      <li>
    	A makefile, as described above; and
      </li>
      <li>
    	a directory named <b>tests</b> that contains a command file and associated
	dictionary and input files, for code coverage tests, as described above under 
	<b>Building and Testing Your Program</b>.
	<p/>
      </li>
    </ul>

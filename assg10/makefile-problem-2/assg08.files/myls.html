<h1>CSc 352: myls</h1>

The purpose of this problem is to implement the basic functionality of
the Unix command <b>ls</b> that lists the files in a directory.  The intent is
to give you both practice working with command line arguments, and also some
experience manipulating Unix system data structures.
<p/>
Background information on how directories are represented is given below
in the section <b>Background: Reading Unix Directories</b>.
<p/>

<h2>The Problem</h2>

Write a C program that behaves as follows:
<p/>
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Invocation:</b>
    Your program will be compiled to an executable named <b>myls</b> and invoked as follows:
     <blockquote>
       <b><tt>myls</tt></b> &nbsp; [ <i>dirName</i> ]
     </blockquote>
     where square brackets represent an optional command-line argument.
     If specified, <i>dirName</i> is the name of a directory.
     <p/>
   </li>
   <li>
     <b>Behavior:</b>
     Your program should list on <b>stdout</b> the contents of the directory 
     specified on the command line, including hidden files.  If no command line
     argument is provided, the contents of the current directory (i.e., the
     directory in which the program is being executed) should be listed.
     <p/>
   </li>
   <li>
     <b>Errors:</b> The following are fatal errors.  In each case, your program
     should give an appropriate error message and exit with status <b>1</b>.
     <p/>
       <ul>
         <li>
 	   Too many command-line arguments.
         </li>
	 <li>
	   The command line argument specified is not the name of a directory.
	 </li>
	 <li>
	   The directory to be processed cannot be opened successfully (this can
           happen if the file specified does not exist, or is not a directory, or does
           not have appropriate permissions).  Use <b>perror</b> to generate 
	   meaningful error messages.
         </li>
       </ul>
     <p/>
   </li>
   <li>
     <b>Output:</b>
     The file names should be listed, one per line, sorted in the order specified
     by <b><tt>strcmp</tt></b> (i.e., <i>f1</i> should come before <i>f2</i> if 
     <i>f1</i> precedes <i>f2</i> according to <b><tt>strcmp</tt></b>).  
     All of the file names in the directory, including any hidden files, should
     be listed.  No other output other than that specified here should be generated.
     <p/>
   </li>
</ul>

<h2>Assumptions and Restrictions</h2>

     The point of this exercise is to work with
     pointers and dynamic data structures.  Programs that use 
     statically preallocated memory, or which use arrays and
     <b>realloc</b>, will not get credit.
     <p/>


<h2>Building and Testing Your Program</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Code coverage:</b> 
    In addition to the source code for your program, you should submit
    test cases that achieve at least 90% code coverage under <b>gcov</b>.
    Code coverage tests will be done on code that
    has been formatted using <b>indent &ndash;kr</b>.
    <p/>
    Writing code coverage tests for this problem has two wrinkles, both related to
    the fact that the program's execution is no longer driven just by inputs
    read from <b>stdin</b>.  First, the execution paths taken&ndash;and therefore
    the code coverage obtained&ndash;will depend on the command line options specified.
    Second, the program's execution will depend on the dictionary and/or input files
    specified.
    <p/>
    To deal with these issue, submit your code coverage tests in a directory
    <b>tests</b> as specified below.
    <p/>
    <ul>
      <li>
	The directory <b>tests</b> contains the files (both dictionaries and input
	files) used by your coverage tests.  You can name these files whatever you like.
      </li>
      <li>
	The directory <b>tests</b> contains a single file <b>runtests</b> that
	contains a set of commands to run your program, one command per line.
	An example is shown <a href="example-runtests-myls" target="_blank">here</a>.
	Once you have created this file of commands, you can execute all of the
	commands within this file using the command
	<blockquote>
	  <b><tt>sh  tests/runtests</tt></b>
	</blockquote>
	<b>Note:</b> Each command in the <b>tests/runtests</b> file should work when
	executed in the directory containing the Makefile and the executable for
	this program.
	<p/>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p/>	
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Makefile:</b>
    In addition to your source files, you should submit a make file
    named <b>Makefile</b> that supports at least the following functionality:
    <blockquote>
      <dl>
        <dt><b>make myls</b></dt>
        <dd>Compiles the C source code to create an executable named
    	<b><tt>myls</tt></b>.  The compiler options used should
    	include <b><tt>-Wall</tt></b>.
    	<p/>
      </dd>
      <dt><b>make coverage</b> (phony target)</dt>
      <dd>
        Compiles the source program with the <b>gcc</b> options needed
        by the <b>gcov</b> tool, namely, 
        &quot;<b><tt>-fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage</tt></b>&quot;.
        <p/>
      </dd>
      <dt><b>make clean</b> (phony target)</dt>
      <dd>
        Deletes all object files (<b><tt>*.o</tt></b>), if any, as well as the
        executable <b><tt>myls</tt></b> and files generated by <b>gcov</b>
        (<b><tt>*.gcov, *.gcno, *.gcda</tt></b>).
      </dd>
      </dl>
    </blockquote>
    <p/>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Submitting Your Assignment</h2>

    Collect all of the files related to this assignment, as described below, into a
    directory named <b>myls</b> and use the <b><tt>turnin</tt></b> command to submit
    this directory (this will cause all of the files in the directory to be submitted).
    The directory <b>myls</b> should contain:
    <p/>
    <ul>
      <li>
        the C source code for your program;
      </li>
      <li>
    	A makefile, as described above; and
      </li>
      <li>
    	a directory named <b>tests</b> that contains a command file and associated
	dictionary and input files, for code coverage tests, as described above under 
	<b>Building and Testing Your Program</b>.
	<p/>
      </li>
    </ul>

<h2>Background: Reading Unix Directories</h2>

Conceptually, A directory can be thought of as a file containing a series
of entries, one entry per file contained in that directory.  However, these
entries are not represented as simple text strings, and as a result we
cannot use input routines such as <i>scanf</i> to process directories.
Instead, we use system calls such as <b>opendir</b>, <b>readdir</b>, 
<b>rewinddir</b>, and <b>closedir</b> to handle directories.
<p/>
Reading a directory consists of the following steps (see the man
pages for further details):
<p/>
<ol>
  <li>
    Open the directory using the system call <b>opendir</b>.  This returns a
    <i>directory stream</i>, which is of type
    <blockquote>
    <b><tt>DIR *</tt></b>
    </blockquote>
    and which will subsequently be used by other code to read and
    process the contents of the directory.
    Make sure you check the return value of <b><tt>opendir</tt></b> to 
    determine whether the directory was opened successfully.
    <p/>
  </li>
  <li>
    Once a directory stream has been opened, the system call <b><tt>readdir</tt></b> can
    be used to directory entries corresponding to individual files.  Each call
    to <b><tt>readdir</tt></b> returns (a pointer to) information corresponding to a
    single file in the directory; this is of type 
    <blockquote>
      <b><tt>struct dirent *</tt></b>
    </blockquote>
    (this is discussed below in more detail).  <b><tt>readdir</tt></b> does its own
    bookkeeping internally and keeps track of how much of the directory it has
    read (and, therefore, what the next entry is), so you don't have to update
    the directory stream yourself in any way.
    <p/>
  </li>
  <li>
    If, at any point, we want to re-read the contents of the directory from the
    beginning, this can be done using the system call <b><tt>rewinddir</tt></b>.
    <p/>
  </li>
  <li>
    At the end, when we are finished processing the directory, we can close the
    directory stream using the system call <b><tt>closedir</tt></b>.
    <p/>
  </li>
</ol>
<p/>
Your code might therefore look something like this:
<blockquote>
  <b><tt>
      DIR *dir_ptr;<br/>
      struct dirent *dirent_ptr;<br/>
      ...<br/>
      dir_ptr = opendir(</tt></b><i>filename</i><b><tt>);<br/>
      ...<br/>
      for ( ... ) {<br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; dirent_ptr = readdir(dir_ptr);</tt></b><br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; <i>... process</i><b><tt> dirent_ptr ... <br/>
      }<br/>
      ...<br/>
      closedir(dir_ptr);<br/>
  </tt></b>
</blockquote>

The second step above requires further explanation.  The structure of a
directory entry is as follows (see <b><tt>man readdir</tt></b> or
<b><tt>man dirent.h</tt></b>):

<blockquote>
<b><pre>
struct  dirent {
    ino_t          d_ino;       /* inode number */
    off_t          d_off;       /* offset to the next dirent */
    unsigned short d_reclen;    /* length of this record */
    unsigned char  d_type;      /* type of file; not supported
                                   by all file system types */
    char           d_name[256]; /* filename */
};
</pre></b>
</blockquote>

Of these fields, the only one that is relevant for this assignment is
<b><tt>d_name</tt></b>, which gives
the name of the file corresponding to the directory entry.

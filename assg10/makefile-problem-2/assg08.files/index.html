<h1>CSc 352 (Spring 2016): Assignment 8</h1>
<p/>
<b>Start Date:</b> Thu March 24, 2016<br/>
<b>Due Date:</b> 11:59 PM, Fri April 1, 2016
<p/>
The purpose of this assignment is to start working with command-line
arguments and file I/O, and to continue working with pointers
and dynamic memory allocation.
<p/>
<h2>General Requirements</h2>
<ol>
<li>
Your C code should adhere to
the <a href="../../DOCS/coding-standards.html" target="_blank">coding
standards</a> for this class.  In particular, your programs should
not give rise to any errors when run under Valgrind.
<p/>
</li>
<li>
Normal execution should be indicated via an exit status of <b>0</b>.
If any errors are encountered during execution, this should be indicated
via an exit status of <b>1</b>.
<p/>
</li>
<li>
  <a href="../misc/assume.html">This document</a> specifies what you can
  assume without checking and what you should check.
  <p/>
</li>
</ol>

<h2>Submission Instructions</h2>

Your solutions are to be turned in on the host <b>lectura.cs.arizona.edu</b>.
Submit your solutions using the <b><tt>turnin</tt></b> command,
using the assignment name appropriate to your section, as shown below:
<p/>
See <b><tt>man turnin</tt></b> for more information about the <b><tt>turnin</tt></b>
command.
<p/>

<h3>Regular turnin</h3>

<blockquote>
    <b>Section 1</b>: &nbsp; 
      <b><tt>turnin &nbsp; cs352s16-sec1-assg8</tt></b>  &nbsp; <i>files</i><br/>
    <p/>
    <b>Section 2</b>: &nbsp; 
      <b><tt>turnin &nbsp; cs352s16-sec2-assg8</tt></b>   &nbsp; <i>files</i>
    <p/>
</blockquote>

<h3>Extra-credit turnin</h3>

<blockquote>
    <b>Section 1</b>: &nbsp; 
      <b><tt>turnin &nbsp; cs352s16-sec1-assg8xc</tt></b>  &nbsp; <i>files</i><br/>
    <p/>
    <b>Section 2</b>: &nbsp; 
      <b><tt>turnin &nbsp; cs352s16-sec2-assg8xc</tt></b>   &nbsp; <i>files</i>
    <p/>
</blockquote>

<h2>Problems</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    <a href="spellcheck.html" target="_blank">Spellcheck</a>
    <p/>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="myls.html" target="_blank">Myls</a>
    <p/>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="gdb-command.html" target="_blank">GDB Commands 2</a>
    <p/>
  </li>
</ol>
<p/>
<h2>Extra Credit</h2>

You can get up to 10% extra credit on each of the <b>spellcheck</b> and <b>myls</b> 
problems by freeing all of the memory
that was allocated dynamically (i.e., via <b>malloc</b>) during execution.  
<p/>
You can use Valgrind to determine whether you have freed all dynamically allocated
memory.  If you have, Valgrind will print
<p/>
<blockquote>
  <b><tt>
      HEAP SUMMARY:<br/>
      in use at exit: 0 bytes in 0 blocks<br/>
      ...<br/>
      All heap blocks were freed -- no leaks are possible</tt></b>
</blockquote>
<p/>
In order to get the extra credit, your program must satisfy the following 
two conditions for  <u>all</u> test inputs:
<ol>
  <li>
    all dynamically allocated memory is freed; and
  </li>
  <li>
    there are no memory errors.
  </li>
</ol>
<p/>
Both these properties will be checked using Valgrind.
<p/>
You should submit your programs separately for extra credit, using a different
turnin assignment name, as indicated above.  For each of these problems, your
score will be the bigger of the score on your regular submission and (if 
submitted) your extra-credit submission.
<p/>
The reason for setting up the extra credit separately is to protect you
if, for any reason, there are any bugs in your memory-freeing code.
This way, you can submit one
set of files for &quot;regular&quot; credit and (possibly) a different set of
files for extra credit; and you will still get credit for the
&quot;regular&quot; submission even if there are problems in the
extra-credit submission.  Of course, you are free to submit the same set
of files for both the regular and the extra credit submission.
<p/>
<b>NOTE:</b>
If you want your code to be submitted for extra credit, you <u>must</u>
submit it as an extra-credit turnin.  
<p/>
For each of the two problems mentioned, your extra credit will be 10% of
your score for the problem.  Thus, if you get 82 out of 100 for a problem
and your extra credit submission meets the two requirements mentioned above,
you will get an additional 8.2 points (10% of 82), for a total score of 90.2.

<h2>Policy Reminder:</h2> 
While we fully expect that students in this class have the
highest ethical and moral standards, 
we will be running plagiarism-detection software on student submissions
as a routine measure.

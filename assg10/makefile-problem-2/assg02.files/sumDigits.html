<h1> 352: Sum the Digits</h1>

<p ><span >This assignment you will write a program to input some integers and for each one
calculate the sum of its digits. For example, given 8762 you would calculate 8 + 7 + 6 + 2 = 23
 </span></p>



<p><span >Write a program, in a file <span><b>sumDigits.c</b></span>, that behaves as specified below. </span></p>

<ul>
 <li ><b><span >Input:</span></b><span> The input is a sequence of positive integers. These numbers may or
     may not be on the same line. </span></li>
 <li><b><span>Behavior:</span></b><span> Your program should read in the input numbers, 
 and for each number n calculate
     the sum of its defined above. Your program should print out each of these sums
on a separate line using the command	 </span></li>


<blockquote style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-bottom:5.0pt'>
<tt>printf("%d\n", num);</tt>



</blockquote>


where num is the sum of digits calculated. Nothing else should be sent to stdin!
</ul>
<ul>
 <li><b><span>Error
     Conditions:</span></b><span > It is an error if the input contains any
     non-positive integers or any non-integer values. Non-positive values in
     the input should not produce any output to <b>stdout</b>,
     but anytime an error is encountered a message should be sent to 
     <b>stderr</b>. A non-positive input should not cause the program to exit.
     If the input contains something
     that cannot be read as an integer (i.e., </span><span><tt><b><span>(</span></b></tt></span><tt><b><span>
	 &quot;%d&quot;, ...)</span></b></tt><span> is unable to read anything), 
	 your program should print an error to <span>stderr</span> and exit.</span></li>
</ul>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'><span>The exit
status of your program should indicate whether or not an error was encountered
at any point during processing. </span></p>

<ul>
 <li><b><span>Comments:</span></b><span> This is a straightforward problem of reading in numbers 
 and calculating the digits of each one (and then summing those digits)
     by performing a series of arithmetic
     operations on it. Your solution should <u>not</u> use strings or arrays.
     </span></li>

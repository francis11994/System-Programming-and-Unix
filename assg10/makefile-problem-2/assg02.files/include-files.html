<h1><span><span>CSc</span></span><span> 352: Include Files</span></h1>

<p><span>The program <a
href="silly.c" target="_blank"><span>silly.c</span></a> (this progrm can also be found on lecture in
the directory <b> /home/cs352/spring16/Assignments/assg02/ </b>) has had all of its </span><tt><b>
<span>#include</span></b></tt><span> directives mysteriously deleted; as a result, the program no longer
compiles. You are to figure out which files you need to include, add the
appropriate </span><tt><b><span>#include</span></b></tt>
<span> directives to the file so that it compiles without any
warnings or errors using &quot;</span><span><tt><b><span>gcc</span></b></tt></span><tt><b>
<span> -Wall</span></b></tt><span>&quot;, and turn in the file so modified. The order in which the
include-files are listed in the file you turn in is unimportant. </span></p>

<p><b><span>Important:</span></b><span> Do not include more files than necessary.
Do not change the name of the file. </span></p>

<p><b><span>Comment:</span></b><span> You don’t need to know what this silly
program does, you just need to make it compile without warnings or errors. The
missing include-files cause the compiler to generate syntax errors.
Symbols (e.g., </span><tt><b><span>NULL</span></b></tt><span> 
) used in the program are specified in the
missing include-files — without them, we get syntax errors. To fix the problem,
start with the library functions in the program, figure out what the relevant
include-files are, and add the appropriate </span><tt><b><span>#include</span></b></tt>
<span> directives; this will usually take care
of defining associated symbols.
If you aren't sure whether something is
the name of a library function, use </span><tt><b><span>man</span></b></tt>
<span> (in some cases you may have to specify the
section 3). </span></p>
<p>Once again, you do not have to understand or run the program. You just have to get it to compile without
warnings or errors by adding the minimual number of #include directives. If you DO want to run it you should
know that you need to type the command followed by an integer greater than 1. If you run it without this
integer it will rudely Abort. This is not an error. This is bad program design. Here's an example of how
to run the program if you want to:
</p>
<p>
gcc -Wall silly.c <br />
./a.out 34

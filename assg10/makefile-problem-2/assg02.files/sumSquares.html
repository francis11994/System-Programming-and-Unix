<h1>CSc 352: Sum of Squares</h1>
Write a program, in a file <b>sumSquares.c</b>, as specified below:
<p/>
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Behavior:</b>
    The program reads in two positive integers <i>m</i> and <i>n</i> from <b><tt>stdin</tt></b>
    and prints out all the numbers in the interval <b>[</b><i>m</i>, <i>n</i><b>]</b>
    (i.e., <i>m</i> and <i>n</i> are included in the range of values considered) which can be
	written as the sum of two squares. A number N can be written as the sum of two squares if there
	exists two postive integers p and r such that N = p<sup>2</sup> + r<sup>2</sup>. For example, 5 can be
	written as the sum of two squares since 5 = 1 + 4 = 1<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup>. 6, on the other
	hand, cannot be written as the sum of two squares. Also notice that by this definition 4 is not
	the sum of two squares since neither p or r are allowed to be 0. (0 is not positive.)
    <p/>
    If <i>m</i> &gt; <i>n</i> then the interval is empty and nothing is printed out.
    <p/>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Input:</b> Two positive integer values specifying, respectively, the beginning
    and end of an integer interval.
    <p/>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Output:</b> A sequence of numbers in ascending order, one per line, 
    printed out using the statement
    <blockquote>
      <b><tt>printf(&quot;%d\n&quot;, num)</tt></b>
    </blockquote>
    where <b><tt>num</tt></b> is a number that can be written as the sum of two squares which is
	being printed out. Notice that you don't have to print out the squares.
    <p/>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Error Conditions:</b>
    It is an error if your program cannot read two integers from <b><tt>stdin</tt></b>
    or if either of the values read is not positive.
    If an error occurs, your program should print an appropriate error message to
    <b><tt>stderr</tt></b> and exit with the appropriate status value.
    <p/>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Hint:</b>
    You may find the function  <b><tt>sqrt</tt></b> helpful for this program.
	You can use the man command to find information on this function. It is part
	of the math library. Using functions from this library in your program, requires specifying to the 
	compiler/linker that the math library needs to be linked in. you do this by adding
	"lm" at the end of the compiler invocation:
		<b>gcc  -Wall <em><tt>programName.c</tt></em> -lm</b>

    <p/>
  </li>

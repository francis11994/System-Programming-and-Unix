<h1>CSc 352: mymake</h1>

This program aims to give you further experience in working
with pointers and dynamic memory allocation, and get you started 
with command-line arguments and file I/O.
<p/>

<h2>The Problem</h2>

This problem involves writing a C program that implements part the core
    functionality of the <i>make</i> utility.  This assignment involves
    reading in a file specifying dependencies and rules as in <i>make</i>
    (though with a different and more explicit syntax);
    constructing a dependency tree; and then traversing the tree starting
    with some specified target.  The extension to actually check timestamps
    and execute the associated commands where necessary will be part of a future
    assignment.
<p/>
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Invocation:</b> Your program will be compiled to an executable named
    <b>mymake</b> (see under <b>Makefile</b> below).  It will be invoked as follows:
    <blockquote>
      <b>makefile</b> &nbsp; <i>aMakeFile</i> &nbsp; <i>aTarget</i>
    </blockquote>
    <i>aMakeFile</i> is is a file specifying dependencies and
	rules according to the format given
	<a href="mymake-spec.html">here</a>; and <i>aTarget</i> is the
	name of a target appearing in <i>aMakeFile</i>.
    <p/>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Behavior:</b> 
An invocation &quot;<b><tt>mymake</tt></b> <i>aMakeFile</i>
	<i>aTarget</i>&quot; of your program should behave as follows:
	(i)
	    read in the targets and dependencies specified in
	    <i>aMakeFile</i> and construct the corresponding
	    <a href="dependency-graph.html#structure">data dependency graph</a>;
	(ii) traverse this graph using a <i>postorder traversal</i>,
	    starting at the node corresponding to the target <i>aTarget</i>,
	    as specified <a href="dependency-graph.html#post-order">here</a>.
	    (The
	    	Wikipedia <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_traversal">discusses</a>
			the general notion of tree traversals, including
	    postorder traversals, in more detail.)
            <p/>
	    <b><u>Important</u>:</b> Your program should free all
	    dynamically allocated memory before exiting.
  </li>
  <li>
	<b>Files:</b> You should structure your program so that
	conceptually distinct pieces of the program reside in distinct
	files.  For instance, the code for reading the makefile specifications
	might be in a different file from the fuctions dealing with graphs. (for example, 
	finding a node, adding a node, traversing the graph, etc.) You should include at
	least 2 different files of source code and one header file. You can include more if
	you feel so inclined. <p />
  <li>
	<b>Output:</b> The output produced by your program is a sequence of
	node names obtained from the postorder traversal of the dependency graph;
	an example is given <a href="dependency-graph.html#post-order">here</a>.
	<p/>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Errors:</b> 
    Error messages should be sensible and informative (use <b>perror</b> where necessary)
    and should be sent to <b>stderr</b>.
    <p/>
    The following are all fatal errors and should cause the program
    to exit immediately with exit status <b>1</b>.
    <p/>
    <ul>
      <li>
	    An input file or a target is not specified.
      </li>
      <li>
	    Too many arguments are specified.
      </li>
      <li>
	    The input file cannot be opened for reading.
      </li>
      <li>
	    The input file is in an illegal format (meaning it doesn't follow the spec
	    given <a href="mymake-spec.html">here</a>).
      </li>
      <li>
        The specified target is not defined in the input file.
      </li>
     </ul>
    <p/>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Assumptions and Restrictions</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Assumptions:</b> You may assume that a <i>word</i> in the
	input mymake file has length at most 64.
    <p/>
  </li>
  <li>
     <b>Restrictions:</b> 
     The point of this exercise is to work with
     pointers and dynamic data structures.  Programs that use 
     statically preallocated memory will not get credit.  You will also
     not get credit for solutions that use <b>realloc</b> or which
     simulate <b>realloc</b> by making repeated calls to <b>malloc</b> or
     <b>calloc</b>.
     <p/>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Building and Testing Your Program</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Code coverage:</b> 
    In addition to the source code for your program, you should submit
    test cases that achieve at least 90% code coverage under <b>gcov</b>.
    Code coverage tests will be done on code that
    has been formatted using <b>indent &ndash;kr</b>.
    <p/>
    As in the last assignment, the input for this program does not just come from standard in.
	Thus your tests need input files, but also the correct arguments to call the program. We
	will deal with this the same way as was done before. Namely:
    
    <p/>
    <ul>
      <li>
	The directory <b>tests</b> contains the inpute files used by your coverage tests.  
	You can name these files whatever you like.
      </li>
      <li>
	The directory <b>tests</b> also contains a file <b>runtests</b> that
	contains a set of commands to run your mymake program, one command per line.
	An example is shown <a href="example-runtests-mymake" target="_blank">here</a>.
	Once you have created this file of commands, you can execute all of the
	commands within this file using the command
	<blockquote>
	  <b><tt>sh  tests/runtests</tt></b>
	</blockquote>
	<b>Note:</b> Each command in the <b>tests/runtests</b> file should work when
	executed in the directory containing the Makefile and the executable for
	this program.
	<p/>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p/>	
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Makefile:</b>
    In addition to your source files, you should submit a make file
    named <b>Makefile</b> that supports at least the following functionality:
    <blockquote>
      <dl>
        <dt><b>make mymake</b></dt>
        <dd>Compiles the C source code to create an executable named
    	<b><tt>mymake</tt></b>.  The compiler options used should
    	include <b><tt>-Wall</tt></b>.
    	<p/>
      </dd>
      <dt><b>make coverage</b> (phony target)</dt>
      <dd>
        Compiles the source program with the <b>gcc</b> options needed
        by the <b>gcov</b> tool, namely, 
        &quot;<b><tt>-fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage</tt></b>&quot;.
        <p/> 
      </dd>
      <dt><b>make clean</b> (phony target)</dt>
      <dd>
        Deletes all object files (<b><tt>*.o</tt></b>), if any, as well as the
        executable <b><tt>mymake</tt></b> and files generated by <b>gcov</b>
        (<b><tt>*.gcov, *.gcno, *.gcda</tt></b>).
      </dd>
      </dl>
    </blockquote>
    <p/>
	<font color = "red">
	<b>New requirements:</b> Your makefile should also use macros to specify the compiler flags
	and should use pattern rules like those given in the slide titled 
	<em><b>Telling make how to process 	files</b></em>
	from the lecture notes on make. In other words, there should be only one command in the
	makefile to build all your object files.
	</font>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Submitting Your Assignment</h2>
    Collect all of the files related to this assignment, as described below, into a
    directory named <b>mymake</b> and use the <b><tt>turnin</tt></b> command to submit
    this directory (this will cause all of the files in the directory to be submitted).
    The directory <b>mymake</b> should contain:
    <p/>
    <ul>
      <li>
        the C source code for your program;
      </li>
      <li>
    	A makefile, as described above; and
      </li>
      <li>
    	a directory named <b>tests</b> that contains a command file and associated
	dictionary and input files, for code coverage tests, as described above under 
	<b>Building and Testing Your Program</b>.
	<p/>
      </li>
    </ul>

<p>As has been announced in class and on piazza, you may correct and resubmit some of your
programs to regain some of the points lost for failed test cases. The amount of points you
get back will be determined by the percentage of your code you need to change. An explanation 
for how this is calculated is given <a href="../../partial-credit.html" target="_blank">here</a></p>

<p>For assignment 5, both <b>maxPerLine</b> and <b>wordCount</b> are elegible to be corrected and submitted
for a regrade.
<p/>
Solutions for these programs have been posted. You are free to look at these solutions to see
one way the problems can be solved. You may NOT, however, copy these solutions. Once again, DO NOT
COPY THE GIVEN SOLUTIONS. The reason to allow you to correct your code and resubmitt it is to 
give you an opportunity to learn from your mistakes. Nothing is learned by just copying, and so
points will not be given for doing a copy and paste.
<p />
Clearly, if you passed all the test cases then there is no need to submit your program again.
Only submit corrected code if your new code passes test cases that your original code failed.
<p/>
<h2><span>Submission Instructions</span></h2>

<p><span>Follow the same instructions as you used to turn in your original assignments.
In other words, turn in the directories with all the files required (source, makefile, tests, etc.)
just as you did before. The turnin variables for this regrade are given below. </span></p>

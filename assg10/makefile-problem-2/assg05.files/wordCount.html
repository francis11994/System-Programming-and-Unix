<h1>CSc 352: Word Count</h1>

Write a C program <b>wordCount</b>, to print a frequency count of all the words coming from input from stdin. 
The
list of words and their counts will be listed in alphabetical (lexigraphical) order as specified below:
<p/>
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Input:</b> <p/>
    Text from stdin. The text will be limited in size to no more than 1024 words (including repeats).
    <p/>
  </li>
  <li>
  <b>Definition of words</b><p />
  Words are strings that are separated by white space. Therefore, you can (and should) use
  scanf to read in each string as a word. However, we must do some further processing. Imagine the
  input includes the line: "Cats rained down on other cats inlucding the purple cats." Notice that
  the following <em>words</em> appear in the input "Cats", "cats", and "cats." We would like to count
  them all as the same word, "cats". To do this we will process every string separated by white space
  as follows:<p/>
  <ol>
    <li>
	Convert all the uppercase letters to lowercase.
	</li>
	<li>
	  Strip all the nonalphabetic symbols from the front of the string.
	</li>
	<li>
	  Strip all the nonalphabetic symbols from the end of the string.
	</li>
  </ol>
  <p/>
  Following this process "cats!" becomes "cats", "**WARNING**" becomes "warning",
  "Planet9" becomes "planet". This is not a perfect solution. For example "you're" stays "you're",
  but we don't want the program to be too complex.
  Notice that this procedure can leave you with an empty string if the string has no alphabetic characters.
  For example, "99" and "&" both become "". Your program should ignore such strings. They are NOT
  concedered to be errors in the input, nor should they be included in the word count.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Output:</b><p/>
    After all the input has been read, your program should print out the list of words
	together with the number of times each appeared. Each word and count
	should be on its own line. Use the following 
	print statement:
    <blockquote>
      <b><tt>printf(&quot;%s %d\n&quot;, word, num)</tt></b>
    </blockquote>
    where <b><tt>word</tt></b> is the word and <b><tt>num</tt></b> is the number of times it
	appeared in the input.
    <p/>
  </li>
    <li>
    <b>Assumptions:</b> <p />You can <a href="../misc/assume.html" target="_blank">assume</a>
    that each of the words read from the input is at most 128 characters long and that the input
	contains no more than 1024 words including repeats.<p/> For example the input below:<br/>
	<b>I am the eggman. You are the eggman. I am the Walrus.</b><br />
	contains 12 words and its output should be:<br/>
	<b>am 2<br/>
	are 1<br/>
	eggman 2<br/>
	i 2<br/>
	the 3<br/>
	walrus 1<br>
	you 1<br/></b>
	
    <p/>
  </li>
<li>
    <b>Error Conditions:</b><p/>
    none
    <p/>
  </li>
    <li>
    <b>Makefile:</b><p/>
    In addition to your source files, you should submit a make file
    named <b>Makefile</b> that supports at least the following functionality:
    <blockquote>
    <dl>
      <dt><b>make wordCount</b></dt>
      <dd>Compiles the C source code to create an executable named
	<b><tt>wordCount</tt></b>.  The compiler options used should
	include <b><tt>-Wall</tt></b>.
	<p/>
      </dd>
     <dt><b>make coverage</b> (phony target)</dt>
      <dd>
	Compiles the source program with the <b>gcc</b> options needed
	by the <b>gcov</b> tool, namely, 
	&quot;<b><tt>-fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage</tt></b>&quot;. to create an executable 
	named <b><tt>wordCount</tt></b>.
	<p/>
      </dd>
      <dt><b>make clean</b> (phony target)</dt>
      <dd>
	Deletes all object files (<b><tt>*.o</tt></b>), if any, as well as the
	executable <b><tt>wordCount</tt></b> and files generated by <b>gcov</b>
	(<b><tt>*.gcov, *.gcno, *.gcda</tt></b>).
      </dd>
    </dl>
    </blockquote>
    <p/>
	<b>Note:</b> the 'C' in <b>wordCount</b> is uppercase. All the other letters are lowercase.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Submitting your assignment:</b><p/>
    Collect all of the files related to this assignment, as described below, into a
    directory named <b>wordCount</b> and use the <b><tt>turnin</tt></b> command to submit
    this directory (this will cause all of the files in the directory to be submitted).
    The directory <b>wordCount</b> should contain:
    <p/>
    <ul>
      <li>
	the C source code for your program;
      </li>
      <li>
	A makefile, as described above; and
      </li>
      <li>
	a directory named <b>tests</b> that contains a set of inputs for your
	program that meets the following requirements:
	<ul>
	  <li>
	    each distinct input is in a different file; and
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    collectively, they achieve at least 100% code coverage for your program
	    (as measured by <b>gcov</b>). 
	  </li>
	</ul>
	<p/>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
<li>
    <b>Suggested Approach:</b><p/>
    Since the input has a maximum size in terms of number of words, you might want to use an array
    to store all the processed words. After all the words are input, you can sort them. This should
    make it easy to count how many times each word occurs. There are several built in functions that
    can be of use in this assignment. For example use the man page to look at <b>tolower</b>,
	<b>isalpha</b>, <b>strcmp</b>, and <b>strdup</b>.
    <p/>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Example:</b>
    Suppose the input consists of the following lines:
    <blockquote>
      <b><tt>
	  It was the best of times, <br/>
	  it was the worst of times,
      </tt></b>
    </blockquote>
    Then the output should be
    <blockquote>
      <b><tt>
	  best 1<br/>
	  it 2<br/>
	  of 2<br/>
	  the 2<br/>
	  times 2<br/>
	  was 2<br/>
	  worst 1<br/>
      </tt></b>
    </blockquote>
	
  </li>
</ul>
